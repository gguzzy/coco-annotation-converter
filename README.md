# COCO Annotation Converter

## Description

**COCO Annotation Converter** is a Python script designed to convert annotations from the `pred_coco.json` format to the COCO Results Format. This tool is useful for those working with COCO datasets who need to transform predictions into a compatible format for analysis and evaluation.

## Features

- **Support for Various Annotation Structures:** Handles annotations as dictionaries containing the `annotations` key as well as lists of annotations.
- **Confidence Score Filtering:** Allows setting a minimum score threshold to include only relevant detections.
- **Category Management:** Maps category names to their respective IDs based on ground truth annotations.
- **Support for Segmentations and Keypoints:** Includes segmentation and keypoint information if present in the annotations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

    cd coco-annotation-converter
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

    ```bash

    pip install argparse
    ```

## Usage

Run the `converter.py` script via the command line, specifying the paths to the necessary files.

```bash
python converter.py --pred PATH_TO_PRED_COCO_JSON --output OUTPUT_PATH [--score_thresh THRESHOLD]
